Both found a deep inspiration in the landscape—its colours, light, materials—returning again and again to sites that inspired their creativity and defined their practices.\nThis exhibition builds on an ongoing program that offers opportunities to consider the art of Emily Carr in a different light. Past exhibitions have focused on directly shared histories or on stylistic affinity, while others have pointed to the significance of Carr’s influence on modern and contemporary artists. Emily Carr and Edith Heath never met, but they do share a common identity as modernist women who lived on the West Coast and struggled to build careers in the creative arts that spoke to the specificity of their time and place.\nEdith Heath was born in Ida Grove, Iowa in 1911 to a settler family from Denmark. She was trained as a teacher and studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago during the mid-1930s. She moved with her husband Brian to San Francisco in 1942 and studied ceramics at the California School of Fine Arts for two years; this is the same school that Emily Carr attended in 1890–93. While studying, Heath also taught art at a progressive co-operative school. During this time the Heaths spent weekends exploring clay pits in California, and Edith Heath conducted independent research on clays, glazes and their chemistry. This commitment to place and process shaped her practice for the remainder of her life. The works selected for this exhibition date from Heath’s early professional career, from the mid-1940s to the late 1950s. It was during this time that she began her annual summer journeys to Vancouver—at first to teach ceramic design and chemistry at the University of British Columbia (1951 and 1952). Soon the trip became a pilgrimage that included Vancouver and Aspen, the site of the legendary International Design Conference, which brought together progressive thinkers and makers in the fields of design and commerce.\nEmily Carr was born in Victoria, BC in 1871 to a settler family from England. In 1890, while still in her late teens, she travelled to San Francisco to attend the California School of Design, the same school where Heath studied in the early 1940s. She studied there for three years before returning to Victoria, where she taught children’s art classes, saving enough money to go to England and continue her art studies there from 1899 to 1904. Upon returning to the West Coast, Carr resumed her travels to coastal Indigenous communities where she documented what she feared to be disappearing cultures. Deeply shaped by her education within colonialist traditions of landscape and documentary, she struggled to reconcile her training with her personal experience of the communities, landscape and history. The works she produced at this time were predictable, so much so that Carr conceived of a plan to travel to France in 1910. She hoped to engage with the new ideas and techniques in art that were emerging there. In less than a year she and her art underwent a radical transformation that set the stage for new ways of looking and making. The works selected for this exhibition reflect Carr’s transformed style and date from the 1930s.\n","id":0,"length":557,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"/"},{"content":"Edith Heath and Emily Carr are unlikely companions in an exhibition and yet they shared a [their] [our] gallery space as if they were old friends with a wealth of mutual interests. Their individual commitment to the land and their recognition of its fundamental importance to all aspects of life on the west coast is their most immediate and compelling point of intersection. For both artists the land was a real and tangible presence that deeply affected the subjects they chose, the tools they used, and the objects they made. Seen together in the same space, their works share a generous conversation where each acknowledges the other’s world vision while articulately rendering the specificity of their own time and place.\nThe exhibition From the Earth: Edith Heath and Emily Carr was originally conceived as part of the Gallery’s ongoing series of exhibitions committed to the documentation and contextualization of the art of Emily Carr. Carr’s paintings and drawings are a highly respected and beloved part of the Vancouver Art Gallery’s permanent collection, and the Gallery has maintained a longstanding program of exhibitions that bring new insights to her art. The opportunity to bring Carr’s paintings and works on paper into dialogue with Edith Heath’s ceramics came about through a casual conversation with Jay Stewart (one of the exhibition’s co-curators) who has an intimate knowledge of the work of both artists. Stewart recalled a conversation she had with Edith Heath about the life and work of Emily Carr in which she mentioned Carr’s technique of tasting clay in order to determine its mineral content and, ultimately, its suitability for use in ceramics. Edith Heath agreed that this was a time-tested and pragmatic way of selecting suitable clays in the local landscape. This simple affirmation of the primacy of the materials, intimately connected to the land, opened the door to further discussions on other shared values and purposes in their lives and works, and ultimately led to this exhibition. Edith Heath had many links to Vancouver and this region, especially during the period of her annual visits in the early 1950s when she taught at the University of British Columbia summer school. Heath is renowned as a key figure in the emergence of mid-century ceramics on the West Coast and we are delighted to have this opportunity to share her work with our members and visitors in Vancouver.\nWe thank the co-curators Jay Stewart, Jennifer Volland and Bruce Grenville, for bringing their unique perspectives on the art of Edith Heath and Emily Carr to this exhibition and publication. Both Jennifer Volland and Jay Stewart have had long-standing, individual curatorial relationships with the Vancouver Art Gallery collaborating as guest curators on key exhibitions at the Gallery since the late-1990s. We are delighted to bring them together, with the Gallery’s senior curator Bruce Grenville, to realize this important exhibition. We are grateful for their many contributions that made this exhibition possible. Michael Lis of Goodweather Studio played a key role in the exhibition’s design producing a remarkable mise-en-scène that united the work of two great artists in a very pleasing and informative space. Gallery staff tracked the hundreds of individual and institutional loans that comprised the Heath component of the exhibition. This is the largest exhibition of Heath ceramics to date and the Gallery registrars, Jenny Wilson and Amber McBride, and conservators, Tara Fraser and Beth Wolchock, applied their ever-rigorous methodology to this unique project. The Gallery’s graphics team led by Martin Chester produced and installed the many text and images in the exhibition, and Angie Milligan thoughtfully designed the Edith Heath timeline. The installation team led by Jim Stamper, skillfully recreated the unique display cabinets (from the original 1959 design of Luther Conover) for the exhibition, built specialized ceramics mounts, and composed the lighting that brought all of the works to life. This unique co-publication was designed by Michael Lis and produced by Stephanie Rebick in her capacity as director of publications at the Gallery. The excellent photography which documents the exhibition was produced by Ian Lefebvre, Blaine Campbell and Rachel Topham. We are grateful to each and every one of our staff and colleagues for their diligence and care in producing this exhibition.\nWe are thankful for the many individual and institutional lenders to the exhibition who shared their love of Edith Heath’s ceramics with our members and visitors. The Brian and Edith Heath/Heath Ceramics Collection is an integral part of the Environmental Design Archives at UC Berkeley. Extensive loans from its comprehensive collection of artifacts, ceramics, and archival photographs made this exhibition possible. Former EDA curator Chris Marino’s oversight on these loans was essential and greatly appreciated. Reference archivist Katie Riddle and curator emerita Waverly Lowell were also instrumental in the process. Selected loans from the Brian \u0026amp; Edith Heath Foundation and Heath Ceramics allowed us to represent unique early ceramics, and a wealth of loans from individual collectors, including Catherine Bailey and Robin Petravic, Allan Collier, Bill Janyk, Julie Muñiz, the Estate of Marion and Gordon Smith, Jay Stewart and Peter Macnair, Tasha Sutcliffe, Chris and Jody Vajda, and Joni and Stephen Vajda, allowed us to convey Heath’s vision for the abundance of ceramics in everyday life.\nThe Brian \u0026amp; Edith Heath Foundation manifests its commitment to scholarship and the dissemination of the art and ideas of Edith Heath through its generous support of the exhibition and publication. We are profoundly grateful for the vision and commitment of the Heath Foundation. We are equally grateful to our other Major Supporters, Kimberly Cudney and Fraser Phillips, who, together with our Major Sponsor: Mosaic Forest Management, Major Community Partner: Poly Culture North America, and the generous support of The McLean Foundation, made this exhibition possible.\nFinally, we extend our deep appreciation to the Board of Trustees of the Vancouver Art Gallery for their continued commitment to the Vancouver Art Gallery and our ambitious and interdisciplinary programs.\nAnthony Kiendl, Vancouver Art Gallery\n","id":1,"length":989,"title":"Director’s Foreword","type":"essay","url":"/101_foreword/"},{"content":"Edith Heath and Emily Carr: From the Earth brings together the work of two artists who had a mutual understanding of the land as the source and meaning of their art.

In 1943, she and her husband Brian spent weekends driving around California looking for clay deposits. With many clay-mining operations closed during World War II, the couple found defunct clay pits and gathered materials. They collected brick clays from Niles Canyon in the San Francisco Bay Area; white clay from Tesla, California; talc from Southern California; and eventually high refractory fire clays, which are used primarily to produce fire brick, from Ione, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.\nAt the time, most clays used in dinnerware were processed to the point that they were white rather than the natural colour and texture of the state’s iron-rich clay. Heath rebelled against white clay—what she referred to as “gutless”—and instead embraced the inherent variation found in California clay.\nAlongside her explorations in the natural environment, Heath enrolled in a ceramic chemistry class at the University of California Extension program and spent time in her kitchen studio testing the properties of various ceramic materials. Heath’s research on clay bodies led to pioneering changes in the ceramics industry. In choosing a less processed California fire clay for her clay body, she produced less material waste. Also, in her clay body she implemented a eutectic system—a process whereby a mixture of substances melts at a lower temperature than that of any of its individual constituents—which resulted in lower energy use during firing. Such environmentally conscious practices ensured both product and process had a strong connection to the earth.\nCalifornia materials would remain an integral part of Heath’s manufacturing philosophy and the California landscape a constant source of inspiration.\n","id":3,"length":285,"title":"1. California Clay / Early Experiments","type":"entry","url":"/the_exhibition/201-california_clay/"},{"content":"       Expand Gumpscaption texxtVancouver Art Gallery  --- Edith Heath’s 1944 solo exhibition at the Legion of Honor caught the eye of Bill Brewer, a buyer for the San Francisco retail company, Gump’s. Due to the dearth of European imports during World War II, he was scouting high-quality ware for the store. Brewer consigned almost all the pieces in the exhibition, and to ensure on ongoing supply of ceramics, he offered Heath a studio at 565 Clay Street for $50 a month. The ceramicist’s informal, yet elegant, hand-thrown dinnerware service dovetailed nicely with Gump’s preferred aesthetics of the time. Heath became one of a group of local designers and craftspeople who supplied Gump’s with quality handcrafted works. The collective force of these creative individuals helped shape post-war tastes in the Bay Area and beyond.\nThe dinnerware—plates, bowls, cups, saucers and a few accessories—was offered in soft blue, pale green and warm beige. While these pieces were prototypes of what would become the eponymous Coupe line, they stand apart from the later production ware. The Gump’s pieces are thinner, with a matte finish, more variation in colour and prominent speckling. The connection to the earth is evident, and highlighting this connection became a standard refrain in the marketing language for Heathware. A Gump’s brochure features a photograph of Heath throwing a pot on the wheel with text that emphasizes the materiality of the dinnerware, formed from “honest, unadulterated clay.”\nIn my thinking about the relationship between material and the finished results, the finished results should reveal the origin. In other words, when you look at a piece, you should be aware this is clay, it\u0026rsquo;s not plastic.\n","id":4,"length":274,"title":"2. Gump's / Hand Thrown to Production","type":"entry","url":"/the_exhibition/202-gumps/"},{"content":"The original line of Heath California dinnerware, later known as the Coupe line, included a place setting comprised of three plates, a dessert bowl, a teacup and a saucer, complemented by two serving bowls, a creamer and sugar bowl set, salt and pepper shakers, and a platter. It quickly expanded to include casseroles, bowls, platters, ashtrays and other accessories in a variety of sizes that catered to a new, informal West Coast lifestyle. The introduction of this line marked the transition from solely hand-thrown ware to more industrialized production using jigger wheels and slip casting. Seventy-five years later, the Couple line is still in production—a testament to its durability and simple, enduring forms.\nWhen factory production began in 1947, Heathware was available in four glazes reminiscent of Heath’s hand-thrown line for Gump’s—Sand, Shining Sand, Sage and Blue. The palette reflected the colour and texture of the California landscape and complemented indoor-outdoor living. Edith Heath rigorously tested her glazes, asking customers to share what they thought of each experiment. Her intention was to visually integrate the glazes with the clay, reflecting its warm tone and unique speckle. Two more glaze colours—Aqua and Apricot—were introduced along with Heath Ceramics’ line of tabbed casseroles in late 1947. The glazes expanded the company’s palette yet retained Heathware’s quintessential speckle and earthiness.\nI designed Heath dinnerware so it could be used in the oven, out of a sturdy material with edges that minimize chipping, in colours and textures that become a part of the fabric of contemporary architecture and life—sturdy for everyday use, yet sufficiently sophisticated for more formal occasions.\n","id":5,"length":265,"title":"3.

Advertisements for two sizes of ashtrays listed the existing dinnerware colours along with the new Currie, Gunmetal and Green Lustre glazes. Verde, Currie and Rock Red brought an increased saturation of colour to the line, while Gunmetal and Green Lustre introduced an elegant metallic look.\nHeath dinnerware is designed for the contemporary home—for indoor and outdoor living—designed for durability and function, pleasant whether used on the patio or for formal ware.\n","id":6,"length":101,"title":"4.

She continued her fascination with the interaction between clay and glaze. A porcelain slip applied to the interior of the ware blocked the effect of the manganese in the clay body, creating two distinct colours from the same glaze.\nHeath Ceramics Coupe dinnerware line, two-toned porcelain-lined, beginning 1955 Heath Ceramics California fire clay and manganese body (with variations in materials over time)\nCollections of the Brian and Edith Heath Foundation, Heath Ceramics, Catherine Bailey and Robin Petravic, Allan Collier, Jay Stewart and Peter Macnair, and Tasha Sutcliffe\nThe Turquoise/Brown combination was the first to use an exposed clay edge; this became a defining feature of Heathware. Turquoise/Brown accompanied the existing two-toned patterns released a few years prior and was advertised alongside pieces from the buffet service. Not only did the colourful palette lend itself to entertaining, so too did the expanded offering of oversized and versatile serving pieces, such a large 15 ½–inch platter, a huge party bowl and a pouring bowl with ladle for gravies and batters.\nDesigning for industry means thinking about many…many-of-a-kind for many people.

It was also featured as a full-page reproduction in September 1936 issue of Survey Graphic, titled “Draggin’-Around People” and captioned “A blighted pea crop in California in 1935 left the pickers without work. This family sold their tent to get food.” Also in this issue was an article by Taylor entitled “From the Group Up.” His report on demonstration projects of the New Deal’s Resettlement Administration in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and California was illustrated with four more picture by Lange.\nSince it was first published, this composition, best known as Migrant Mother, has come to represent not only the pictorial archive created by the RA/FSA during the 1930s but also the Great Depression itself. Posters and other publicity of later activists fighting racial, economic, and political oppression have borrowed from Lange’s icon of the time. The handsome, androgynous face, the pose of stoic anxiety, and the encumbrance of three young children proved to be universal attributes. With Lange’s artistry, Owens took on the timeless quality of Eugéne Delacroix’s strong female rebel (Liberty Leading the People), Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian ideal), Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman) and Käthe Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the mothers leading her Peasants’ War).\nOwens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more children and kept moving with her family, following the California crops. She did become involved in efforts to organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking season begins. She was still working in the fields at age fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson) and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.\nExhibitions Tradition and Innovation: Recent Additions to the Photographs Collection, the J.
