Luther W. (Bill) Conover (b. 1913; d. 1993, Larkspur, California), a Sausalito-based furniture designer known for his work in metal and wood, designed and fabricated the showroom cabinets for the purpose-built Heath Ceramics factory in 1959. His cabinets were re-created for this installation; an original set of wrought iron supports were used on the Exposed Clay Edge and Two-toned Porcelain-lined display cabinet.
