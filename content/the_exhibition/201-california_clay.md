Edith Heath’s affinity for and fascination with her surrounding landscape informed her art. In 1943, she and her husband Brian spent weekends driving around California looking for clay deposits. With many clay-mining operations closed during World War II, the couple found defunct clay pits and gathered materials. They collected brick clays from Niles Canyon in the San Francisco Bay Area; white clay from Tesla, California; talc from Southern California; and eventually high refractory fire clays, which are used primarily to produce fire brick, from Ione, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.

At the time, most clays used in dinnerware were processed to the point that they were white rather than the natural colour and texture of the state’s iron-rich clay. Heath rebelled against white clay—what she referred to as “gutless”—and instead embraced the inherent variation found in California clay.

Alongside her explorations in the natural environment, Heath enrolled in a ceramic chemistry class at the University of California Extension program and spent time in her kitchen studio testing the properties of various ceramic materials. Heath’s research on clay bodies led to pioneering changes in the ceramics industry. In choosing a less processed California fire clay for her clay body, she produced less material waste. Also, in her clay body she implemented a eutectic system—a process whereby a mixture of substances melts at a lower temperature than that of any of its individual constituents—which resulted in lower energy use during firing. Such environmentally conscious practices ensured both product and process had a strong connection to the earth.

California materials would remain an integral part of Heath’s manufacturing philosophy and the California landscape a constant source of inspiration.
